# Exploring the system
### More fun with `ls`
* specify the current working directory to list:
```
$ ls
```

* specify the directory to list:
```
$ ls /home
```

* specify multiple directories
```
$ ls ~ /usr
```
list both the user's home directory and the /usr directory.

##### Options and arguments

### Determining a file's type with file
```
$ file filename
```

### Viewing file with less
There are many ways to represent information on a computer.One of the eariest and simpliest is ASCII(short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
```
$ less filename
```
**less commands:**

| command | Action
| ------- | ------
| G       | Move to the end of the file
| 1G or g | Move to the beginning of the file
| n       | search for the next occurrence of the previous search
| h       | Display help screen
| q       | Quit less

**Less is more :**

Less was designed as an improved replacement of an earlier Unix program called *more*.

### Symbolic Links
It is a little like version control.you create a symbolic link pointing to a file,and when the file has a new version,you can create a new symbolic link pointing to it or delete the old one and create a new one.

### Hard Links
Symbolic Links and Hard links are two types of Links that allow files to have multiple names.
