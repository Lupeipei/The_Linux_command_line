# The environment

### What Is Stored In The Environment?
-  The shell stores two basic types of data in the environment.

- They are **environment variables** and **shell variables**.

- Shell variables are bits of data placed there by bash, and environment variables are everything else.

#### Examining The Environment

```
printenv | less
set | less
```

-  `set` command : show both the shell and environment variables.

- `printenv`  only display the environment variables.

you can also use `echo` to view the contents of a variable.

```
echo $HOME
```

**Note :**

 One element of the environment that neither `set` nor `printenv` displays is **aliases**.

to see them, using :

```
alias
```

#### Some Interesting Variables

Environment Variables:

| Variable | Contents |
| -------- | -------- |
| DISPLAY | The name of your display if you are running a graphical environment. Usually this is “:0”, meaning the first display generated by the X server. |
| EDITOR | The name of the program to be used for text editing. |
| SHELL | The name of your shell program. |
| HOME | The pathname of your home directory. |
| LANG | Defines the character set and collation order of your language. |
| OLD_PWD | The previous working directory. |
| PAGER | The name of the program to be used for paging output. This is often set to /usr/bin/less. |
| PATH | A colon-separated list of directories that are searched when you enter the name of a executable program. |
| PS1 | Prompt String 1. This defines the contents of the shell prompt. As we will later see, this can be extensively customized. |
| PWD | The current working directory. |
| TERM | The name of your terminal type. Unix-like systems support many terminal protocols; this variable sets the protocol to be used with your terminal emulator. |
| TZ | Specifies your timezone. Most Unix-like systems maintain the computer’s internal clock in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and then displays the local time by applying an offset specified by this variable. |
| USER | Your username. |

### How Is The Environment Established?

- When we log on to the system, the bash program starts, and reads a series of configuration scripts called *startup files*, which define the default environment shared by all users.

- This is followed by more startup files in our home directory that define our personal environment.

- The exact sequence depends on the type of shell session being started. There are two kinds: **a login shell session** and **a non-login shell session**.

Login shell sessions read the following startup files:

| File | Contents |
| ---- | -------- |
| /etc/profile | A global configuration script that applies to all users. |
| ~/.bash_profile | A user's personal startup file. Can be used to extend or override settings in the global configuration script. |
| ~/.bash_login | If ~/.bash_profile is not found, bash attempts to read this script. |
| ~/.profile | If neither ~/.bash_profile nor ~/.bash_login is found, bash attempts to read this file. This is the default in Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu. |

Non-login shell sessions read the following startup files:

| File | Contents |
| ---- | -------- |
| /etc/bash.bashrc | A global configuration script that applies to all users. |
| ~/.bashrc |A user's personal startup file. Can be used to extend or
override settings in the global configuration script. |


The **~/.bashrc file** is probably the most important startup file from the ordinary user’s point of view, since it is almost always read.


### Modifying The Environment

#### Which Files Should We Modify?

- As a general rule, to add directories to your PATH, or define additional environment variables, place those changes in **.bash_profile** (or equivalent, according to your distribution. For example, Ubuntu uses .profile).

- For everything else, place the changes in **.bashrc**.

#### Text Editors

GNOME and KDE both include some popular graphical editors.

- GNOME ships with an editor called **gedit**, which is usually called “Text Editor” in the GNOME menu.

- KDE usually ships with three which are (in order of increasing complexity) **kedit**, **kwrite**, and **kate**.


There are many text-based editors. The popular ones we'll encounter are **nano, vi, and emacs**.

### Using A Text Editor

```
gedit some_file
atom some_file
vim some_file
```

As an example, Let's fire up nano and edit the .bashrc file.

```
cp .bashrc .bashrc.bak
nano .bashrc
```
You can add some commands in the .bashrc file to change the configuration. such as `umask 0002`.

The extensions **“.bak”, “.sav”, “.old”, and “.orig”** are all popular ways of indicating a backup file.

#### Activating Our Changes

```
source .bashrc
```
